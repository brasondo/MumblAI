I just been sittin' at the top, with a whole lot of guap, I been rockin' them Rick Owens
I seen a lot of y'all bitin' the swag, y'all be copyin' the swag, bitch, I seen my kids growing
Everyday it's some new bullshit
Y'all just be capping, y'all don't even be doing shit
I jump at the side 
I jump at the side
All my diamonds flawless, y'all so broke, them boys SI
I stayed down with the samе people, y'all be switching sidеs
It feel like I've been booted off this X for fifty nights
I've been high, I feel I've been up in the sky for fifty flights
Can't believe clout's such a drug, y'all do some shit for fifty likes
And your bitch you said you love, pull up and ride me, fifty bikes
All my diamonds way too flawless
Watch these bitches hit, they shine
Y'all be cryin' 'bout some shit you never did once in your life
Yeah, pulled up on this thotty, you got bored, I switched the sides
This bitch skinny, she got Mac and Cheese pussy it sound like spaghetti
I'm 'bout to go up to the top I know that they ain't ready for me
All my diamonds Michael Phelps, these bitches been swimming on me
I talk different with my twizzys, we got a different language
Yeah, I told his bitch, "I need the cranium, the Helmut Lang bitch" (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm just pushin' this Rolls Royce to eighty lanes, bitch
I can tell that you broke, we don't be on the same language
